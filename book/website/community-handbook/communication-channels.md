# Communication Platforms

_The Turing Way_ delivery team uses a number of communication platforms to share the work of the community outwards, and to communicate in real-time as well (alongside GitHub, which hosts the project repository and all sorts of updates). 

Examples of this may include social media platforms, as well as real-time messaging services. 

This section aims to collect the policies and practices that we employ across our communication platforms in one place, which you are free to use for your own community platforms.
