# 管理一个新的社区和团队

As researchers, scientists and 'techies' we look for ways to use our skills to solve pressing, current issues.

The most recent example is the COVID-19 pandemic and related events {cite:ps}`WHO2020Jul` worldwide including the global lockdown that started in February 2020. The research communities responded with a sudden surge of hackathons, data modelling projects, task forces, and working groups to find effective and immediate technical solutions to combat this health crisis.

这种面向行动的努力产生于汇集和汇集我们的科学知识以处理前所未有的局势的动机。 这肯定是向前迈进的理想途径。 Nevertheless, forming effective collaborations is a challenging process, even in the best of times. Keeping a team engaged is a continuous activity that requires regular checking in and evaluation. Based on each evaluation we can change and improve our workflow and community practices. 然而，当我们匆忙制定一个项目来解决眼前的问题时， 我们没有时间进行这样的评估。 Therefore it is even more important to be intentional when creating teams and communities and apply the tried and tested best practices from the beginning.

So, how can we ensure that the teams and research communities we form during the time of urgency are built on the foundation of excellent science and community practices? 帮助研究人员解决这一问题，特别是在短期内(例如大流行病)启动社区或以团队为导向的项目时， 我们根据社区和技术专家的经验汇编了建议。 在这一章中，我们讨论了有助于使一个项目真正富有成效的重要方面，同时成功地面向社区。 我们还讨论了处理项目中可能出现的技术问题的有益办法。 In the third subchapter, we urge our readers to identify their stakeholders, actively invite them to participate and value the differences that exist in their teams and communities.

我们希望，本章建议的做法将为与你们的团队和社区建立成功的协作提供一个良好的起点。 We want to prompt everyone to think critically not just about the technicalities of the work, but also the social environment in which it is being conducted.
