Generalisable
  Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.

Machine Readable
  Machine readable refers to documents, data or other digital outputs whose content can be readily processed by computers. Such documents are distinguished from machine readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created. Machine readable data can be defined as data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.

repo2docker
  A tool to build Docker images from code repositories.

Rendered Output
  This is what the text will look like on an online page in Github or web page

Robust
  A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.
