Generalisable
  Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.

Machine Readable
  Machine readable refers to documents, data or other digital outputs whose content can be readily processed by computers. Such documents are distinguished from machine readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created. Machine readable data can be defined as data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.

  Documenting and sharing research data openly for re-use.

Open Educational Resources
  Making educational resources publicly available to be re-used and modified.

Open Source Hardware
  Documenting designs, materials, and other relevant information related to hardware, and making them freely accessible and available.

  The persona canvas can be used to assemble all your responses in one place, share this tangible information of your mental model (abstract concepts from our thoughts) with your colleagues and create a common language to communicate about your community members, users, and contributors.

Phony Target
  A phony target is one that doesn’t correspond to a file on the filesystem. A target is marked as phony by making it a prerequisite of the .PHONY target.

Power Users
  These are people who are already familiar enough with a platform to know the gotchas and tricks that make their experience more efficient.

Prerequisite

Pull Request
  Proposed changes to a remote repository. Collaborators without write access can send a pull request to the administrator with the changes they’ve made to the repo. The administrator can then approve and merge or reject the changes to the main repository. For open source projects pull requests can be sent by anyone that has forked a project.

Push
  Sending changes to a remote repo. The remote repository is updated with the changes pushed and now mirrors the local repo.

  A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.

repo2docker
  A tool to build Docker images from code repositories.

Repository
  *Same as Data or Code Reprository*. A long-lived place on the internet where resources (be they data, software, publications or anything else) can be stored and accessed. This keyword is often shortened to ‘repo’.

Rendered Output
  This is what the text will look like on an online page in Github or web page

Research Compendia
  This is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including data, code, texts (protocols, reports, questionnaires, metadata). The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straight forward.

Risk Assessment
  This is used to help choose the appropriate sustainable software concepts for your project.

Risk Matrix
  A risk matrix is a way of quantifying what’s going on with the thing you’re interested in. One axis measures exposure in some way, and the other the impact of a mishap. The further from the origin, the more safeguards are needed to make the risk acceptable.

Roadmapping
  This is the creation of a roadmap for your project. It is an outline for the work you need to do. It covers your goals, vision and a timeline for tasks.


Robust
  A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.
